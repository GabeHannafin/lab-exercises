     <h2>Examples of common vulnerabilities</h2>
     <article id="sql" class="content text-paragraph">
       <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
       <p>
       SQL injection is a form of command injection that occurs when user input to a SQL query is not sanitised or checked properly before running.
       </p>
       <p>
       Let's take this portion of SQL for example.
       </p>
       <code>
         SELECT cool_chair
         FROM chairs
         WHERE color="red";
       </code>
       <p>
       Here is a query to get a red chair. But what would happen if instead of "red" we inputted a double quote?
       The <b>WHERE</b> clause would now look like: <code>WHERE color=""";</code>.
       <p>
       This is clearly invalid sql and will not execute correctly,
       but what if we append a comment onto the end? now the <b>WHERE</b> clause looks like <code>WHERE color="" -- -";</code>.
       </p>
       <p>
       This comments out the last quote and end of the statement,
       allowing us to append more SQL onto the end.
       </p>
       <p>
       We now have the ability to write SQL commands into the input field and have them be run by the server. There are now plenty of attack vectors to try out. 
       </p>
       <p>
       MySQL has a <code>LOAD_FILE()</code> module
       that could allow an attacker to read files off the system. 
       </p>
       <p>
       A very common way approach is to use a "UNION" statement to run a second SQL query and extract data from other tables in the database.
       A website will quite commonly have a users tables for storing login information that you may be able to access and retrieve password hashes from.
       </p>
     </article>
     <article id="lfi" class="content text-paragraph">
       <h3>Local File Inclusion</h3>
       <p>
       Similarly to SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion is caused by incorrect sanitation on user input.
       </p>
       <p>
       Commonly a webserver will use a <b>GET</b> variable in the url to control what html/php file it currently is displaying.
       the url may look like this: "https://example.com/?page=page1.html"
       </p>
       <p>
       If this input is not checked properly we can simply substitute "page1.html" for "../../../../../etc/passwd" (on linux systems) for example to recieve the contents of /etc/passwd.
       </p>
       <p>
       Page1.html is refering to ./page1.html in the web root of the server. Using the "../" to move up the directory tree you can access any file on the filesystem that you have permission to view.
       </p>

     <article id="upload" class="content text-paragraph">
       <h3>Upload Vulnerabilities</h3>
       <p>
       A lot of websites will allow a user to upload a file of some kind. A common example is a profile picture or a thumbnail.
       This is common practice but if configured incorrectly very dangerous.
       </p>
       <p>
       What is to stop you uploading a malicious piece of code instead of a picture? Well there are a few measures put in place:
       </p>
       <ul class="contained-list">
         <li>A server might have a whitelist and only allow certain extensions</li>
         <li>A server might blacklist certain extensions</li>
         <li>A server might check the MIME type header in the HTTP request</li>
         <li>A server might check the magic bytes at the start of the file (used to determine file type)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       These are examples of some of the checks that can be put in place to stop malicious files being uploaded.
       But there is absolutely nothing stopping us editing our HTTP request before it is sent to the server with a tool
       like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">BurpSuite</a> to bypass these checks.
       </p>
       <p>
       If an attacker is able to bypass the upload filter they could upload a malicious php file and possibly get it to be executed by the server
       and get RCE that way.
       </p>
