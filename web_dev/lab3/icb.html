        <h4>French production methods introduced to County Dublin</h4>
        <p>
          Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at <i>Croom Creamery</i> in County Dublin, has
          recently returned from a fact-finding mission to France. So impressed was he with
          <i>le fromage Français</i> that he intends introducing French production methods to his
          factory. Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on strike.

          Irish cheese exports to Europe are flourishing but there are signs that the American
          market is saturated with fat.
