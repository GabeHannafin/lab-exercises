        <h3>September 2021</h3>
        <p><b><i>Certified Humane Label&reg;</i> for <i>Killorglin Mountain Goat Cheese</i></b></p>
        <p>
          We are delighted to announce that <i>Killorglin Mountain Goat Cheese</i> has been
          awarded a Certified Humane Label®. No mountain goat is put into a cage on the end
          of a pole in the making of this cheese. Promise.

        <p>
          ChocoCheese, a delicious, fresh-ripened sheep’s cheese coated with dark chocolate,
          previously available only in Charleville, has now gone into national distribution. If
          you want to get your kids to eat more cheese, buy them ChocoCheese!

        <h3>August 2021</h3>
        <p>Product recall: Bray Brie</p>
        <p>
          Customers are advised that recent batches of Bray Brie are infested with worms. Big
          worms. Worms of the priapulida family. These worms are poisonous.
        </p>
        <p>Do not eat this cheese. Nor the worms. Return this cheese to your retailer.</p>

        <h3>July 2021</h3>
        <p>French production methods introduced to County Dublin</p>
        <p>
          Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at Croom Creamery in County Dublin, has
          recently returned from a fact-finding mission to France. So impressed was he with le
          fromage Français that he intends introducing French production methods to his
          factory. Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on strike.
        </p>
        <p>Irish cheese exports bloom</p>
        <p>
          Irish cheese exports to Europe are flourishing but there are signs that the American
          market is saturated with fat.
