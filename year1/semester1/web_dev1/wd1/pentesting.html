       <h2>Stages of a Pentest</h2>
     <article class="content text-paragraph">
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>
         The First stage includes defining the <em>scope</em> and <em>goals</em> of the test.
         The scope includes defining the <i>IP Adresses</i> that are allowed to be tested.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain <i>IP Addresses</i> may be out of scope if they belong to a system critical
         to the functionality of the company (e.g. in a hospital you would not want to accidently crash any important systems).
        </p>
        <p>
         In this stage the <b>testing methods</b> that are allowed are given. For example, whether
         the person performing the Pentest is allowed to use <i>Phishing Emails</i> on any employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain exploits may not be fully stable and run the risk of crashing the system or causing other
         unwanted side effects.

        <h3>Passive Recon</h3>
        <p><i>Passive Recon</i> is the process of researching and collecting as much information as possible
         without actively making requests to the webserver.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, if the site is a <i>https</i> site, then basic information, like subdomains for example,
         can be found in the website's <i>SSL Certificate</i>.

        As another example, <em>User Names</em> and <em>User Emails</em> can be found through multiple different techniques

        </p>
        <ul class="text-paragraph">
          <li class="contained-list">The company's website may show current staff members or contact emails.</li>
          <li class="contained-list">can be found in whois/DNS information</li>
          <li class="contained-list">Through researching social media accounts/Using online resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Individuals can be researched to find information. It can be useful to know information about different users.
         For example, if someone posts about their favourite singer on social media then that could be a useful
         when generating wordlists for guessing passwords. Also birth dates, childrens' names, etc, are all
         common basises for passwords.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content text-paragraph">
      <h3>Scanning</h3>
      <p>
      This phase is similar to the last, the main difference being that active requests are being sent to the victim server.
      Common scanning methods include: port scanning, directory bruteforcing, subdomain bruteforcing, intercepting http/s requests.
      </p>
      <p>
      A basic port scan in essance connects to every port on a server (1-65535 TCP ports) and returning the response the server sends.

      Common port scanning tools, such as <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a> do a very good job at finger printing different services that
      might be running on a server. Along with whether the port is open the scan may include very useful information such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="contained-list">
        <li>Service vesion Information</li>
        <li>OS information</li>
        <li>available FTP/SMB shares and files</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      All of this information is very important for the next stage, you never know what will come in handy.
      </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content text-paragraph">
        <h3>Initial Access</h3>
        <p>
        Now for the fun stuff. Using the data from the previous enumeration we begin trying to gain access.
        There are countless ways to exploit a server, common routes for websites are: <a href="vulnerabilities.html#sql">SQL Injection</a>, <a href="vulnerabilities.html#upload">Upload Vulnerabilities</a> and 
        <a href="vulnerabilities.html#lfi">Local File Inclusion</a>
        </p>
        <p>These are some very common ways to exploit webpages but they are only a small example of the amount possible</p>
        <p>
        After gaining an intital foothold an attacker might try and escalate privelages to a higher user.
        There are many ways to accomplish this as well, most stemming from incorrect configuration by the owner
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that a public facing machine has been comprimised we now have access to the local network and could try and
        hack other machines within the network to further extend our foothold.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may also try and install some kind of backdoor in the system so that we can access the server without having to repeat
        the initial proccess again.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content text-paragraph">
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
        after the attack has concluded we will write up a report. This report is what is going to make this whole proccess useful to the company.
        </p>
        <p>
        The report should contain detailed explanations and screenshots of the process used to get into the machines, the severity of these vulnerabilities
        and what data was breached in the attack.
        </p>
        <p>
        Using this information a compay can patch and fix any issue found in order to protect themselves in the future.
